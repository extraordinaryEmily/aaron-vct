# TODO
- Interactions for Eco x KDA (synergy) and map preference x HMWR (conditional)
- Remaining transformations like on smoothed OMM and any of the interactions
- Decide on model while looking at how we label win or loss
    - Logistic regression, tree based models, neural networks, ensemble/stacking, hybrid approach
- Remember cross validation, over/underfitting etc, keep in mind linear vs nonlinear interactions and relationships, parameter tuning etc.
