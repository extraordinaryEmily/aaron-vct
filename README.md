# TODO

- Study the plots and data
- Transformation if need to prevent skewing or want to scale features
- Feature selection aside from already removing headhost % and ACS. Decide what to do with weak predictors, maybe can use interactions
- Interactions features like combining features for the model
    - These are interaction terms that often improve predictive power for tree-based or linear models.
- Decide on model while looking at how we label win or loss
    - Logistic regression, tree based models, neural networks, ensemble/stacking
- Remember cross validation, over/underfitting etc, keep in mind linear vs nonlinear interactions and relationships, parameter tuning etc.
- List all the qualifying tier 1?
